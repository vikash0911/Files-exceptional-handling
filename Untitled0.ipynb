Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, offering more flexibility but slower performance. Compiled languages detect errors at compile-time, while interpreted languages catch them during execution."

        "**ans-** Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks. Code that may raise an exception is placed inside the try block. If an error occurs, the except block handles it. The else block executes if no error occurs, and the finally block always runs, regardless of an exception, often for cleanup tasks."

It helps in monitoring and troubleshooting by providing timestamped messages of varying severity levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. The logging module allows you to configure and output logs to different destinations like console, files, or external systems."

It allows for cleanup tasks, like releasing external resources (e.g., closing files or network connections). However, its use is generally discouraged due to the unpredictability of garbage collection timing, and it's recommended to use context managers or explicit cleanup methods instead."
